Cosmiconfig searches for and loads configuration for your program.

It features smart defaults based on conventional expectations in the JavaScript ecosystem.
But it's also flexible enough to search wherever you'd like to search, and load whatever you'd like to load.

By default, Cosmiconfig will start where you tell it to start and search up the directory tree for the following:

- a `package.json` property
- a JSON or YAML, extensionless "rc file"
- an "rc file" with the extensions `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, or `.js`.
- a `.config.js` CommonJS module

For example, if your module's name is "myapp", cosmiconfig will search up the directory tree for configuration in the following places:

- a `myapp` property in `package.json`
- a `.myapprc` file in JSON or YAML format
- a `.myapprc.json` file
- a `.myapprc.yaml`, `.myapprc.yml`, or `.myapprc.js` file
- a `myapp.config.js` file exporting a JS object

Cosmiconfig continues to search up the directory tree, checking each of these places in each directory, until it finds some acceptable configuration (or hits the home directory).

ðŸ‘€ **Looking for the v5 docs?**
v6 involves slight changes to Cosmiconfig's API, clarifying the difference between synchronous and asynchronous usage.
If you have trouble switching from v5 to v6, please file an issue.
If you are still using v5, those v5 docs are available [in the `5.x.x` tagged code](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig/tree/5.2.1).

## Installation

```
npm install cosmiconfig
```

Tested in Node 8+.

## Usage

Create a Cosmiconfig explorer, then either `search` for or directly `load` a configuration file.

```js
const { cosmiconfig, cosmiconfigSync } = require('cosmiconfig');
// ...
const explorer = cosmiconfig(moduleName);

// Search for a configuration by walking up directories.
// See documentation for search, below.
explorer.search()
  .then((result) => {
    // result.config is the parsed configuration object.
    // result.filepath is the path to the config file that was found.
    // result.isEmpty is true if there was nothing to parse in the config file.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Do something constructive.
  });

// Load a configuration directly when you know where it should be.
// The result object is the same as for search.
// See documentation for load, below.
explorer.load(pathToConfig).then(..);

// You can also search and load synchronously.
const explorerSync = cosmiconfigSync(moduleName);

const searchedFor = explorerSync.search();
const loaded = explorerSync.load(pathToConfig);
```

## Result

The result object you get from `search` or `load` has the following properties:

- **config:** The parsed configuration object. `undefined` if the file is empty.
- **filepath:** The path to the configuration file that was found.
- **isEmpty:** `true` if the configuration file is empty. This property will not be present if the configuration file is not empty.

## Asynchronous API

### cosmiconfig()

```js
const { cosmiconfig } = require('cosmiconfig');
const explorer = cosmiconfig(moduleName[, cosmiconfigOptions])
```

Creates a cosmiconfig instance ("explorer") configured according to the arguments, and initializes its caches.

#### moduleName

Type: `string`. **Required.**

Your module name. This is used to create the default [`searchPlaces`] and [`packageProp`].

If your [`searchPlaces`] value will include files, as it does by default (e.g. `${moduleName}rc`), your `moduleName` must consist of characters allowed in filenames. That means you should not copy scoped package names, such as `@my-org/my-package`, directly into `moduleName`.

**[`cosmiconfigOptions`] are documented below.**
You may not need them, and should first read about the functions you'll use.

### explorer.search()

```js
explorer.search([searchFrom]).then(result => {..})
```

Searches for a configuration file. Returns a Promise that resolves with a [result] or with `null`, if no configuration file is found.

You can do the same thing synchronously with [`explorerSync.search()`].

Let's say your module name is `goldengrahams` so you initialized with `const explorer = cosmiconfig('goldengrahams');`.
Here's how your default [`search()`] will work:

- Starting from `process.cwd()` (or some other directory defined by the `searchFrom` argument to [`search()`]), look for configuration objects in the following places:
  1. A `goldengrahams` property in a `package.json` file.
  2. A `.goldengrahamsrc` file with JSON or YAML syntax.
  3. A `.goldengrahamsrc.json` file.
  4. A `.goldengrahamsrc.yaml`, `.goldengrahamsrc.yml`, or `.goldengrahamsrc.js` file.
  5. A `goldengrahams.config.js` JS file exporting the object.
- If none of those searches reveal a configuration object, move up one directory level and try again.
  So the search continues in `./`, `../`, `../../`, `../../../`, etc., checking the same places in each directory.
- Continue searching until arriving at your home directory (or some other directory defined by the cosmiconfig option [`stopDir`]).
- If at any point a parsable configuration is found, the [`search()`] Promise resolves with its [result] \(or, with [`explorerSync.search()`], the [result] is returned).
- If no configuration object is found, the [`search()`] Promise resolves with `null` (or, with [`explorerSync.search()`], `null` is returned).
- If a configuration object is found *but is malformed* (causing a parsing error), the [`search()`] Promise rejects with that error (so you should `.catch()` it). (Or, with [`explorerSync.search()`], the error is thrown.)

**If you know exactly where your configuration file should be, you can use [`load()`], instead.**

**The search process is highly customizable.**
Use the cosmiconfig options [`searchPlaces`] and [`loaders`] to precisely define where you want to look for configurations and how you want to load them.

#### searchFrom

Type: `string`.
Default: `process.cwd()`.

A filename.
[`search()`] will start its search here.

If the value is a directory, that's where the search starts.
If it's a file, the search starts in that file's directory.

### explorer.load()

```js
explorer.load(loadPath).then(result => {..})
```

Loads a configuration file. Returns a Promise that resolves with a [result] or rejects with an error (if the file does not exist or cannot be loaded).

Use `load` if you already know where the configuration file is and you just need to load it.

```js
explorer.load('load/this/file.json'); // Tries to load load/this/file.json.
```

If you load a `package.json` file, the result will be derived from whatever property is specified as your [`packageProp`].

You can do the same thing synchronously with [`explorerSync.load()`].

### explorer.clearLoadCache()

Clears the cache used in [`load()`].

### explorer.clearSearchCache()

Clears the cache used in [`search()`].

### explorer.clearCaches()

Performs both [`clearLoadCache()`] and [`clearSearchCache()`].

## Synchronsous API

### cosmiconfigSync()

```js
const { cosmiconfigSync } = require('cosmiconfig');
const explorerSync = cosmiconfigSync(moduleName[, cosmiconfigOptions])
```

Creates a *synchronous* cosmiconfig instance ("explorerSync") configured according to the arguments, and initializes its caches.

See [`cosmiconfig()`].

### explorerSync.search()

```js
const result = explorerSync.search([searchFrom]);
```

Synchronous version of [`explorer.search()`].

Returns a [result] or `null`.

### explorerSync.load()

```js
const result = explorerSync.load(loadPath);
```

Synchronous version of [`explorer.load()`].

Returns a [result].

### explorerSync.clearLoadCache()

Clears the cache used in [`load()`].

### explorerSync.clearSearchCache()

Clears the cache used in [`search()`].

### explorerSync.clearCaches()

Performs both [`clearLoadCache()`] and [`clearSearchCache()`].

## cosmiconfigOptions

Type: `Object`.

Possible options are documented below.

### searchPlaces

Type: `Array<string>`.
Default: See below.

An array of places that [`search()`] will check in each directory as it moves up the directory tree.
Each place is relative to the directory being searched, and the places are checked in the specified order.

**Default `searchPlaces`:**

```js
[
  'package.json',
  `.${moduleName}rc`,
  `.${moduleName}rc.json`,
  `.${moduleName}rc.yaml`,
  `.${moduleName}rc.yml`,
  `.${moduleName}rc.js`,
  `${moduleName}.config.js`,
]
```

Create your own array to search more, fewer, or altogether different places.

Every item in `searchPlaces` needs to have a loader in [`loaders`] that corresponds to its extension.
(Common extensions are covered by default loaders.)
Read more about [`loaders`] below.

`package.json` is a special value: When it is included in `searchPlaces`, Cosmiconfig will always parse it as JSON and load a property within it, not the whole file.
That property is defined with the [`packageProp`] option, and defaults to your module name
